## General Information

A simple version of a well-known game, implemented to practice Javascript. The positions of the ships are randomly generated each time game is refreshed. The game informs the user every time he misses, sinks a part of the ship, the whole unit, as well as all the ships on the board. Also, when entering wrong coordinates or shooting off the board, a corresponding message appears.

## Technologies

- HTML5
- CSS3
- JavaScript(ES6)

## Minimum Viable Product

MVP is random generating ships localisation, typing coordinants, indicating soot/miss and sinking of the ship. Next features which can be introduce can concern informing about errors or unproper data typed by user.

## Project Status

Project is not developed for now.

## Setup, how to play

1. Clone repository to your machine.
2. Open the `index.html` file in your browser.
3. You're on war and you need to destroy your enemy's ships.
4. Type letter from range A-G to indicate row and 1-6 number for column to make first shot.
5. If you make a first hit, keep looking for neighboring cells to sink whole ship.
6. There are 3 ships on board, keep guessing until you sink all of the ships.
